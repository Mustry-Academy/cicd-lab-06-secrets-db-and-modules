# gateways/ — dev and prod gateway state

This folder holds the **dev** and **prod** gateways' `projects/` and `config/`
directories, bind-mounted into their containers (see `docker-compose.yaml`):

```
gateways/
├── dev/
│   ├── projects/   ← what deploy.yml shipped (push to main)
│   └── config/     ← gateway config, incl. what the deploy copied
└── prod/
    ├── projects/   ← what deploy.yml shipped (dispatch, target=prod)
    └── config/
```

`scripts/setup.sh` creates these subdirectories (and pre-seeds the `cicd` API
token) before the gateways' first boot. Everything except this README is
**gitignored** — it is the *gateways'* state, not the repo's.

Why bind mounts instead of named volumes: you can verify a deploy landed
without touching Docker at all:

```bash
ls gateways/dev/projects            # what did the last dev deploy ship?
ls gateways/prod/projects           # and the last release?
```

Treat these directories as **read-only**: they are fed by CI (`docker cp` +
scan from the workflows). Editing them by hand defeats the pipeline you are
building — change `projects/` or `services/config/` in the repo and let a
deploy ship it instead.
